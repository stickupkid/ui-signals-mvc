UI-Signals-MVC
--------------

This framework is a port of pureMVC[1] there are slight modifications, which include

	1) The internal event bus is based on signals[2] for speed and performance.
	2) Removal of all singletons, which in turn removes the need for multicore setup.

You can interchange signal libraries, so you can use mine, Robert Penners[3] or Joa Eberts[4]. I've also included the StateMachine utility by default, a messaging system between cores is being devised.

Known issues
------------

	1) This hasn't been tested in the wild.
	2) No unit tests, these should be coming.
	3) Missing comments and correct accreditation. This will come asap (sorry!).
